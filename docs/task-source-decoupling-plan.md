# Task Source Decoupling and PM Agent Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to decouple agent-conductor from GitHub-specific task management and enhance the PM agent's capabilities to function as an intelligent task coordinator. The current system has tight coupling to GitHub issues, limiting its applicability to other task management systems and reducing the PM agent's effectiveness as a project coordinator.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE LIMITATION

**This plan requires a complete rewrite of agent-conductor in a different programming language.**

The current agent-conductor system is implemented entirely in bash scripts, which presents fundamental limitations for implementing the proposed sophisticated features:

### Bash Limitations for This Architecture:
- **No Object-Oriented Programming**: Cannot implement adapter patterns, strategy patterns, or complex class hierarchies
- **Limited Data Structures**: No native support for complex objects, interfaces, or type systems
- **API Integration Challenges**: Difficult to implement robust HTTP clients, JSON parsing, and async operations
- **State Management**: No sophisticated state management or persistence capabilities beyond file I/O
- **Error Handling**: Limited exception handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Testing Complexity**: Challenging to implement comprehensive unit testing for complex logic
- **Maintainability**: Large bash codebases become difficult to maintain and debug

### Languages Better Suited for This Architecture:
- **Python**: Rich ecosystem for API integrations, excellent for AI/ML features, strong testing frameworks
- **Go**: Great for concurrent operations, strong typing, excellent CLI tools
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Good for API integrations, familiar to many developers, strong ecosystem
- **Rust**: High performance, excellent error handling, strong type system

### Recommendation:
Before implementing this plan, the team should consider whether to:
1. **Rewrite in Python/Go/TypeScript** - Enables all proposed features with proper architecture
2. **Hybrid Approach** - Keep bash orchestration but add a service layer in another language
3. **Simplified Bash Implementation** - Scale down the plan to work within bash limitations

The remainder of this document presents the ideal architecture assuming a rewrite in a more suitable language.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing System Limitations

**Tight GitHub Coupling:**
- Task IDs assumed to be GitHub issue numbers throughout the system
- PM agent has hard-coded `gh` CLI commands in prompt
- Deployment requires GitHub issue number: `./orchestrator.sh deploy <agent> <github-issue-number>`
- Configuration mandates GitHub owner/repo/project_number
- All memory files reference GitHub URLs and issue structures
- Project phases directly map to GitHub issue numbers
- Agent prompts contain GitHub-specific workflow instructions

**Current Agent Architecture:**
- **PM Agent**: Direct GitHub API integration, minimal task coordination intelligence
- **Worker Agents**: Technology-specific but GitHub-aware, manual task assignment
- **Communication**: File-based shared memory with GitHub issue references
- **Deployment**: Manual, requires explicit task-to-agent mapping

## Proposed Decoupled Architecture

### 1. Task Source Abstraction Layer

#### Task Source Interface Design

```yaml
# Enhanced task source configuration
task_sources:
  primary:
    type: "github"
    config:
      owner: "your-org"
      repo: "your-repo"
      project_number: 1
      auth_method: "gh_cli"
    
  secondary:
    type: "jira"
    config:
      project_key: "PROJ"
      base_url: "company.atlassian.net"
      auth_method: "api_token"
      
  tertiary:
    type: "linear"
    config:
      team_id: "team-uuid"
      auth_method: "personal_token"

# Task source mapping and prioritization
task_routing:
  default_source: "primary"
  fallback_sources: ["secondary"]
  priority_labels:
    - "critical"
    - "high" 
    - "medium"
    - "low"
```

#### Universal Task Model

```yaml
# Standardized task representation
task:
  id: "universal-task-123"
  source_type: "github"
  source_id: "456" 
  title: "Implement user authentication API"
  description: "Create secure JWT-based authentication system"
  priority: "high"
  status: "open"
  labels: ["backend", "security", "api"]
  assignee: null
  reporter: "product-manager"
  created: "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  updated: "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z"
  due_date: "2025-01-25T00:00:00Z"
  story_points: 8
  dependencies: ["task-122", "task-121"]
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "User can register with email/password"
    - "JWT tokens expire after 24 hours"
    - "Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks"
  custom_fields:
    component: "auth-service"
    epic: "user-management"
```

    task_id: "task-456"
    agent_id: "backend-001"
    blocker_reason: "missing_dependency"
    dependency_task: "task-455"
```

**Agent Communication Protocol:**
```yaml
# Agent-to-PM communication

  heartbeat_interval: 300 # 5 minutes
  status_update_triggers:
    - "task_progress_change"
    - "blocker_encountered"
    - "help_needed"
    - "task_completed"
  
  escalation_rules:
    - condition: "blocked_for > 2_hours"
      action: "notify_pm"
    - condition: "overdue_task"
      action: "urgent_escalation"
```

## Technical Design Patterns

### 1. Adapter Pattern for Task Sources

```bash
# Task source adapter interface
abstract class TaskSourceAdapter {
  abstract fetchTasks(): UniversalTask[]
  abstract createTask(task: UniversalTask): string
  abstract updateTask(id: string, updates: Partial<UniversalTask>): boolean
  abstract deleteTask(id: string): boolean
  abstract subscribeToUpdates(callback: (task: UniversalTask) => void): void
}

class GitHubAdapter extends TaskSourceAdapter { ... }
class JiraAdapter extends TaskSourceAdapter { ... }
class LinearAdapter extends TaskSourceAdapter { ... }
```

### 2. Strategy Pattern for Task Assignment

```bash
# Task assignment strategies
interface AssignmentStrategy {
  assignTask(task: UniversalTask, agents: Agent[]): Agent | null
}

class WeightedScoringStrategy implements AssignmentStrategy { ... }
class RoundRobinStrategy implements AssignmentStrategy { ... }
class SkillBasedStrategy implements AssignmentStrategy { ... }
```

### 3. Observer Pattern for Event Handling

```bash
# Event-driven task coordination
class TaskEventBus {
  private observers: Map<EventType, Observer[]>
  
  subscribe(eventType: EventType, observer: Observer): void
  unsubscribe(eventType: EventType, observer: Observer): void
  publish(event: TaskEvent): void
}
```

## Configuration Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility

```yaml
# Migration-friendly configuration
project:
  # Legacy GitHub configuration (deprecated but supported)
  github:
    owner: "legacy-owner"
    repo: "legacy-repo"
    project_number: 1
  
  # New task source configuration
  task_sources:
    primary:
      type: "github"
      config:
        owner: "legacy-owner"
        repo: "legacy-repo"
        project_number: 1

# Migration flags
migration:
  preserve_legacy_config: true
  enable_warnings: true
  migration_deadline: "2025-06-01"
```
