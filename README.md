# Agent Conductor

A reusable, configuration-driven orchestration framework for managing multiple AI agents working on complex software projects. Agent Conductor provides session isolation, file-based communication, and technology-agnostic coordination for AI agents.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Support**: Currently optimized for **macOS** due to bash command implementations. Linux and Windows (WSL) support is planned for future releases as part of our platform-agnostic roadmap.

## Features

- **Reusable Framework**: Initialize any project with `conductor init`
- **Session Isolation**: Each AI agent runs in its own tmux session
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML configuration defines project-specific settings
- **File-Based Communication**: Agents coordinate through shared memory files
- **Race Condition Safe**: Enhanced communication library with atomic file locking and transactions
- **Technology Agnostic**: Works with any programming language/framework
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests with BATS framework

## ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Integration Dependency

**Agent Conductor is currently tightly coupled to GitHub Issues for task management.**

### Current GitHub Dependencies:
- **Task Assignment**: All deployments require GitHub issue numbers (`conductor deploy rust 123`)
- **PM Agent Integration**: PM agent uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands for project coordination
- **Configuration Requirements**: GitHub owner/repo/project_number must be configured
- **Agent Prompts**: All agent prompts reference GitHub workflows and issue tracking
- **Memory Files**: Task assignments and project state files contain GitHub issue references
- **Project Phases**: Project phases map directly to GitHub issue numbers

### Limitations:
- Cannot be used with other task management systems (Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- Manual task-to-agent assignment required
- PM agent has limited coordination capabilities beyond GitHub integration

### Future Architecture:
See [docs/task-source-decoupling-plan.md](docs/task-source-decoupling-plan.md) for comprehensive plans to decouple from GitHub and create a universal task management abstraction layer. **Note:** This would require rewriting the system in a language other than bash.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Agent Conductor
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akoscz/agent-conductor/main/install.sh | bash

# Initialize your project
cd /path/to/your/project
conductor init

# Configure and deploy
conductor validate
conductor deploy backend 123  # Deploy backend agent for GitHub issue #123
```
